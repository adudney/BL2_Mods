# BL2_Mods
Collection of my Borderlands 2 mods

- Simple: My current master patch file.

- Health COMs: Doubles the health regeneration of the health regen COMs.

- Legendary Pointman: Makes the health bonus MT_PreAdd, and swaps Pressure for Forbearance.

UCP: Adopted from the Unofficial Community Patch v2.1

- Auto Pickup: Enables automatic pickup on Eridium, Torgue Tokens, and Seraph Crystals.

- Flayer: Replaces the Tidal Wave with the Flayer.

- Gen 2 Pearls: Adds generation 2 pearl weapons to the world drop pool at the same rarity as the generation 1 pearls.

- Loot Shields: Adds legendary shields to the Loot Midget drop pool.

- Love Thumper: Disables Love Thumper friendly damage

- Naught: Replaces the Cradle with the Naught.

- Slaughterdomes: Makes the slaughterdomes round 5 mission repeatable.

- UCP Lootpools: Adds the Bouncing Bonny to Wilhelm, adds the FOTFH to Incinerator Clayton, adds the Fire Bee to Nisha, adds the Love Thumper to Henry, adds the Heart Breaker to Blue, adds the Shredifier to Bone Head

Experimental: Haven't been fully playtested, but should work at least partially.

- Aggression: Modifies aggression relics to be "multiplicative". Unfortunately this means they also stop working on any pure-splash weapon. (Except for the Rocket Launcher relic with Rocket Launchers)

- TPS Scaling: Scales health, damage, and shields like TPS does.

- TPS Vendors: Changes Item of the Day chances to their TPS levels when possible. Not exactly the same as TPS, but as close as possible in BL2.

- Less UVHM: Makes UVHM slightly closer to TPS. Swapped bonuses of normal enemies and badass enemies, increased enemy bonuses slightly at 61+ and OP1+, nerfed slag back to 2x, nerfed vehicle damage to 2x, nerfed slag time to 1.5x. Nerfed enemy health regen by 0.5%

Hotfixes: Must be run through the converter util before usable. DO NOT EXEC THESE, THEY WILL NOT WORK

- Axton: Contains the Axton skill changes.

- Axton_Tree: Swaps the locations of Crisis Management and Resourceful

- Simple: Hotfixes for my patch set, enables Raving Retribution rants, adds Gen 2 pearls to OMGWTH's loot pool at OP8 (or at least tries to, haven't playtested this yet), adds the Grog to the Gold Golem's loot pool.

- TPS Skills: Changes skill trees to act like TPS skill trees, such that tier 3 -> 4 only requires one point. Probably overkill, but can be fun to mess around with.

- UCP Base: Base game hotfixes with Vermivorous evolve chances slightly boosted.

- OOO: Buffs OOO's spawn rate by 5x. Was 1%, is now 5%.

- OPLoot: Forces world dropped gear at level 72 and above to always drop on level. Does not work for boss loot yet.
