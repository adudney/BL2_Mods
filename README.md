# BL2_Mods
Collection of my Borderlands 2 mods

- Simple: My current patch set, contains a mix of my own work and bits and bobs from the UCP 2.1.

Experimental: Haven't been fully playtested, but should work at least partially.

- Aggression: Modifies aggression relics to be "multiplicative". Unfortunately this means they also stop working on any pure-splash weapon. (Except for the Rocket Launcher relic with Rocket Launchers)

- TPS Scaling: Scales health, damage, and shields like TPS does.

- TPS Scaling Shields: Same as TPS Scaling but additionally ups the relative values of shields to health, like TPS does. This is probably overkill in BL2 because of the OP levels, which is why it is separate.

- TPS Vendors: Changes Item of the Day chances to their TPS levels when possible. Not exactly the same as TPS, but as close as possible in BL2.
