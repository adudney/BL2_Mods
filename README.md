# BL2_Mods
Collection of my Borderlands 2 mods

- Simple: My current patch set, contains a mix of my own work and bits and bobs from the UCP 2.1.

Experimental: Haven't been fully playtested, but should work at least partially.

- Aggression: Modifies aggression relics to be "multiplicative". Unfortunately this means they also stop working on any pure-splash weapon. (Except for the Rocket Launcher relic with Rocket Launchers)

- TPS Scaling: Scales health, damage, and shields like TPS does.

- TPS Scaling Shields: Same as TPS Scaling but additionally ups the relative values of shields to health, like TPS does. This is probably overkill in BL2 because of the OP levels, which is why it is separate.

- TPS Vendors: Changes Item of the Day chances to their TPS levels when possible. Not exactly the same as TPS, but as close as possible in BL2.

Hotfixes: Must be run through the converter util before usable. DO NOT EXEC THESE, THEY WILL NOT WORK

- Axton: Contains the Axton skill changes

- Simple: Hotfixes for my patch set, enables Raving Retribution rants, adds Gen 2 pearls to OMGWTH's loot pool at OP8 (or at least tries to, haven't playtested this yet), adds the Grog to the Gold Golem's loot pool

- TPS Skills: Changes skill trees to act like TPS skill trees, such that tier 3 -> 4 only requires one point. Probably overkill, but can be fun to mess around with.

- UCP Base: Base game hotfixes with Vermivorous evolve chances slightly boosted
